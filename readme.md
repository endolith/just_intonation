Probably all of this is redundant with [Scala](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/), but

1. I don't know how to use it
2. I wanted to learn by doing:
 * Just Intonation
 * object-oriented Python
 * unit testing

Maybe odd-limit and prime-limit should be objects rather than properties?
"The limit" is a set of intervals, and includes all intervals of `<=` a certain
height, so `.height` should be the property name and `OddLimit` should be a class?
